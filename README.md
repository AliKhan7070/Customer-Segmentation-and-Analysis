# Customer Segmentation and Analysis
This repository contains the implementation of a **Customer Segmentation and Analysis** project developed as part of **Group 18**. The notebook demonstrates the use of various Python libraries to perform document clustering using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- **numpy**: Efficient array operations and mathematical functions for numerical computing.
- **matplotlib**: Comprehensive plotting capabilities for creating 2D and 3D visualizations.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis with powerful data structures like Series and DataFrame.
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization with an emphasis on aesthetics and ease of use.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms for clustering, preprocessing, and evaluation.

## Features
- Implements various clustering algorithms to group similar documents.
- Utilizes visualization techniques to understand the structure and grouping of data.
- Provides an in-depth analysis of the clustering performance and interpretability.

## Running the Notebook
1. Ensure you have Python 3.11 or a compatible version installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AliKhan7070/Document-Clustering.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd Document-Clustering
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Project Final.ipynb"
   ```
